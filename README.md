# Computational Doob's $h$-transforms for Online Filtering of Discretely Observed Diffusions
This is a PyTorch implementation of the methodology described in the article. 

Run the following Python notebooks to repeat experiments for each model:
1. `repeat_OU.ipynb` and `repeat_OU_robust.ipynb` for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model;
2. `repeat_logistic.ipynb` and `repeat_logistic_robust.ipynb` for a logistic diffusion model considered in [Knape and Valpine (Ecology, 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1890/11-0797.1);
3. `repeat_cell.ipynb` and `repeat_cell_robust.ipynb` for the cell differentiation and development model of [Wang et al. (PNAS, 2011)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1017017108).
